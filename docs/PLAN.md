# CPR — Plan (draft v0.1)

> Status: living plan. Settled decisions are in §14; what we learn along the way is in
> [JOURNAL.md](./JOURNAL.md).

## North Star

**Review decisions, not lines.** Every feature must help a reviewer answer, faster than
reading the diff:

1. **What changed in behavior or contract?** (added, removed, signature, body)
2. **Who is affected?** (callers, blast radius)
3. **What is risky?** (findings)

Tie-breakers when trading off: precise beats complete (a wrong finding costs more trust than a
missing one), explainable beats clever (every finding links to code), local and fast beats
hosted.

## 1. Why

Line diffs show *what text moved*. Reviewers need *what decisions were made*:
which functions were added, which contracts changed, and who is affected.

CPR turns a change set into a **graph of changed symbols** (functions, classes,
methods, types) and the **calls between them**, then runs detectors that point
at the risky parts. It runs locally and needs no server.

## 2. Scope

**v1 does**
- TypeScript and JavaScript (`.ts .tsx .js .jsx .mts .cts .mjs .cjs`)
- Compare two git revisions in one repository
- Output a versioned graph JSON and a list of findings
- Run as a CLI (`cpr diff`) on macOS and Linux, Node ≥ 22.12

**v1 does not**
- Support other languages (they come later through adapters)
- Analyze types from `node_modules` beyond what the TS checker gives for free
- Do runtime or dataflow analysis
- Host anything, or require GitHub (that is phase 3)

## 3. Core concepts

| Term | Meaning |
|---|---|
| **Revision** | A source tree for one side of the diff (`base` or `head`). |
| **Symbol** | A named declaration with a stable ID, e.g. `src/user/service.ts#UserService.getUser`. |
| **Change** | How a symbol differs between sides: added, removed, or modified (signature, body, moved). |
| **Edge** | A relation between two symbols (call, reference, extends, implements). |
| **Finding** | A detector result attached to a symbol, with a severity. |
| **Graph** | Nodes + edges + findings. The contract between engine and UI ([graph-schema.md](./graph-schema.md)). |

## 4. Architecture

```
            ┌──────────────┐      graph.json      ┌──────────────┐

            │                     @cpr/cli                      │
            │        cpr diff · cpr view · (later) cpr pr       │
            └───────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

### Packages

| Package | Role | Key deps |
|---|---|---|
| `packages/core` | Engine: revisions, extraction, diff, references, detectors, graph output | `ts-morph` |
| `packages/cli` | Argument parsing, git plumbing, output formatting | `@cpr/core` |
| `packages/viewer` | Graph UI (phase 2) | `react`, `@xyflow/react` |

### Language adapter boundary

The pipeline is language-neutral. Everything TS-specific lives behind one interface,
so other languages (and a possible Rust/oxc core) can plug in later.

```ts
interface LanguageAdapter {
  id: string;                                   // "typescript"
  matches(path: string): boolean;
  load(rev: Revision): Promise<LoadedRevision>; // build the program/project
  extract(rev: LoadedRevision, files: string[]): SymbolDecl[];
  incoming(rev: LoadedRevision, id: SymbolId): EdgeRef[]; // who uses it
  outgoing(rev: LoadedRevision, id: SymbolId): EdgeRef[]; // what it uses
}
```

Diffing, move detection, detectors and graph output are shared code.

### Revision sources

```ts
interface RevisionSource { root: string; sha?: string; dispose(): Promise<void> }
```

- `GitWorktreeSource` — a small **pool of detached worktrees** per repo at
  `<cache>/worktrees/<repo-id>/<role>-<n>`. A run takes a free slot (pid lock file) and moves it
  to the target SHA with `git checkout --detach`, so git only rewrites files that differ and
  disk use stays at a few checkouts per repo. Slots show up in `git worktree list`.
  Cache root: `$CPR_CACHE_DIR`, else `$XDG_CACHE_HOME/cpr`, else `~/Library/Caches/cpr` (macOS)
  or `~/.cache/cpr`.
- `DirectorySource` — a plain folder. Used by test fixtures and for quick experiments.

## 5. Engine pipeline

```
resolve refs → changed files → load projects → extract → hash → diff
            → match moves → references (changed only) → detectors → graph.json
```

1. **Resolve revisions.** `git rev-parse` both refs. Use `merge-base(base, head)` as the
   real base, the same way GitHub computes a PR diff. Flag `--no-merge-base` to compare directly.
   User-supplied refs are passed after `--end-of-options`; everything after uses resolved SHAs.
2. **Changed files.** `git diff --name-status -M <mergeBase> <head>`. Only these files can
   contain changed symbols, so extraction runs on them only. This is the main speedup.
3. **Load projects.** One ts-morph `Project` per side: the root `tsconfig.json`, every config it
   `references`, and every other `tsconfig.json` in the repo (depth ≤ 5), all with the root's
   options; no tsconfig → all sources with defaults. Workspace packages (from `workspaces` or
   `pnpm-workspace.yaml`) are mapped to their **sources in this revision** through `paths`, so
   cross-package references work even when `types` point at an unbuilt `dist/`. Changed files
   are added up front, so the program never changes after loading. Worktree slots get
   symlinks to the user's `node_modules` folders; package symbols are external leaves.
4. **Extract declarations** in changed files, both sides, with stable IDs (§6).
5. **Hash** each symbol twice: `signatureHash` and `bodyHash` (§6.3).
6. **Diff by ID** into `added`, `removed`, `modified{signature, body}`, `unchanged`.
7. **Match moves and renames.** Pair `removed` with `added` symbols, same kind only, in order:
   (a) git file renames keep the qualified name, (b) an identical declaration with the same
   name in another file, (c) an identical body of at least 10 normalized tokens. Members follow
   their container (`C.m` → `D.m` when `C` → `D`). A candidate must be unique on both sides;
   ambiguous cases stay added + removed. Pairs become `modified{moved}` with `previousId`.
   Similarity (non-exact) matching comes later.
8. **References, changed symbols only**, on each side where the symbol exists (base for
   removed and modified, head for added and modified):
   - Incoming (users): language-service `findReferences` from the declaration name; follows
     imports, barrels and renamed re-exports. Each site maps to its enclosing symbol, named
     exactly like extraction; top-level code is `file#(module)`.
   - Outgoing: resolve every identifier in the declaration (aliases followed to the real
     declaration). Package symbols become `<package>#<name>`; calls the checker cannot resolve
     (`obj[name]()`, `any` receivers) become `unknown:<callee>`; lib globals, locals, params and
     type-literal members are skipped.
   - Base IDs of moved symbols are renamed to head IDs; edges merge by (from, to, kind) into
     `side: base | head | both` with sites per side.
   - Unchanged neighbours join as **context nodes** (1 hop by default, `--depth n` widens on the
     head side, capped at 2000 symbols).
   - Type-only references are always collected as `type-reference` edges. The UI hides them by default.
9. **Detectors** (§8).
10. **Emit** `graph.json` + a human summary on stdout.

## 6. Symbols

### 6.1 What counts as a symbol (v1)

| Included | ID example |
|---|---|
| Top-level function | `src/a.ts#parse` |
| Top-level variable; a function-valued one (`const f = () => …`) has kind `function` | `src/a.ts#handler`, `src/a.ts#config` |
| Each name in a destructuring declaration | `const { a, b: [c] } = …` → `#a`, `#c` |
| Class, its methods, constructor, accessors (get+set = one symbol), properties | `src/a.ts#User`, `src/a.ts#User.save`, `src/a.ts#User.constructor` |
| Class property holding a function (`handle = () => …`) has kind `method` | `src/a.ts#User.handle` |
| Interface, type alias, enum | `src/a.ts#UserDto` |
| Namespace and its members (`namespace A.B` nests) | `src/a.ts#Utils.slugify`, `src/a.ts#A.B.x` |
| Default export: unnamed function/class/expression | `src/a.ts#default` (or its name, if it has one) |

Nested functions and callbacks are **folded into their parent's body** in v1.
A change inside them shows up as a body change of the parent.

Not yet extracted: CommonJS exports (`module.exports = …`, `exports.x = …`), ambient
`declare module 'x'` blocks, `export =`. Declaration files (`.d.ts`) and `*.min.js` are skipped.

### 6.2 Stable IDs

Format: `<repo-relative POSIX path>#<qualified name>`.

- Function overloads are one symbol; all overload signatures go into its signature hash.
- Static members always carry a `static:` prefix (`User.static:create`), so they never
  collide with instance members and IDs don't change when a same-named member appears.
- Computed or symbol-keyed members: `User.[Symbol.iterator]`.
- Anonymous default export: `#default`.
- Declaration merging (interface + namespace with one name): one ID, kinds listed together.

### 6.3 Hashing

Both hashes are computed from **normalized AST tokens**, so formatting-only edits do not count
as changes. Ignored: whitespace, comments, JSDoc, quote style (`'a'` = `"a"` = `` `a` ``),
trailing commas, statement and member terminators (`;` / `,`), parentheses around a single
arrow parameter. Still counted (journaled): redundant parentheses around expressions.

| Hash | Input |
|---|---|
| `signatureHash` | exported or not (however it is exported), decorators, modifiers (`async`, `static`, visibility, `abstract`, `readonly`), name, type params, params (name, optional, type, default), declared or inferred return type, heritage clauses for classes. **Interfaces, type aliases and enums: the whole declaration** — their shape *is* their contract. |
| `bodyHash` | function/method body; initializer for variables and properties; for classes and namespaces, the sorted list of member names. Empty string when there is no body (types, abstract methods). |

A class's own change comes from its heritage and member list. Member edits show on the members.

**Inferred return types:** when a function or method has **no declared return type**, the
checker's inferred return type is normalized and added to the signature hash. This catches
`return user` turning into `return user ?? null` with no annotation. Annotated symbols use
the declared text only. Runs on changed symbols only, so the cost is small.

## 7. TypeScript traps

| Trap | Plan |
|---|---|
| **Barrels and re-exports** | Incoming: the language service follows them. Outgoing: `getAliasedSymbol()` to the real declaration. Re-export hops (`via`) are not recorded yet. |
| **Path aliases** | The root config's `paths` (made absolute) merged with generated workspace-package paths. |
| **Monorepo tsconfigs** | All tsconfigs in the repo load into **one** project with the root's options. Limitation: per-package `paths`/options are lost (seen in CPR's own fixtures). Later: one project per config, references searched across them. |
| **Renames and moves** | §5 step 7. Exact body-hash match in v1; similarity matching later. |
| **Dynamic JS calls** | `obj[name]()`, `any`-typed receivers, `require(var)`, `eval`: emit an edge with `resolution: "unknown"` and a text-based guess when a name is visible. Never silently drop them. |
| **JS without types** | Always load with `allowJs` + `checkJs: false`, even when the tsconfig doesn't, so changed `.js` files are part of the program. Resolution is weaker; mark low-confidence edges as `unknown`. |
| **Project's own TS version** | CPR analyzes with ts-morph's bundled compiler (TS 6.0), not the version the project installs. Older configs (`baseUrl`, `moduleResolution: node`, `target: es5`) still work in 6.0 but warn, so projects are loaded with `ignoreDeprecations: "6.0"`. ts-morph is pinned exactly: a release built on TS 7 would drop those options. |
| **Generated files** | Skip `.d.ts` and files matching `.cprignore` / common globs (`dist/`, `build/`, `*.generated.ts`). |

## 8. Detectors (v1)

| Rule ID | Fires when | Severity | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| `removed-still-referenced` | A removed symbol still has callers in `head`. | error | Found via base callers that still exist in head, plus head diagnostics like "Cannot find name" / "has no exported member". Text-match fallback for JS → marked `unknown`. |
| `orphan-added` | An added symbol has no references in `head`. | warning | Downgraded to `info` if it is exported from a package entry point (it may be public API). |
| `signature-changed` | A symbol's signature hash changed. | warning | **Blast radius** = all head callers, split into *updated in this PR* and *untouched*. Untouched callers are the ones to check. |

Every finding links to a symbol ID and its related IDs, so the UI can highlight them.

Later candidates: `exported-api-changed`, `new-cycle`, `caller-not-updated-for-new-param`,
`test-not-touched-for-changed-symbol`.

## 9. CLI (phase 1)

```
cpr diff <base> <head> [options]

  --project <path>      tsconfig to use (default: auto-detect)
  --out <file>          write graph JSON to a file (default: stdout when --json)
  --json                print JSON instead of the human summary
  --no-merge-base       compare base and head directly
  --depth <n>           hops of unchanged context around changed symbols (default: 1)
  --fail-on <severity>  exit 1 if any finding is at or above this level (for CI)
```

Exit codes: `0` ok, `1` failure or `--fail-on` hit, `2` usage error.

Human summary example:

```
cpr: 14 symbols changed (3 added, 1 removed, 10 modified) in 6 files

 ✖ removed-still-referenced  src/user/service.ts#UserService.find
     still called from src/api/routes.ts#listUsers
 ⚠ signature-changed         src/user/service.ts#UserService.getUser
     5 callers · 2 updated · 3 untouched
 ⚠ orphan-added              src/util/date.ts#toIsoWeek
```

## 10. Testing

- **Fixture pairs:** `packages/core/test/fixtures/<case>/{base,head}/`, loaded with
  `DirectorySource`. One case per behavior (rename, barrel, path alias, overload, dynamic call,
  legacy TS 4–style tsconfig…).
- **Golden snapshots:** each case has an expected `graph.json`; tests diff against it.
- **Git integration tests:** a small script builds a temp repo with commits to test
  worktrees, merge-base and rename detection.
- **Dogfood:** run on real PRs from 3 open-source TS repos of different sizes; record
  runtime and false positives.

## 11. Performance budget (v1)

| Repo size | Changed symbols | Target |
|---|---|---|
| ~1k files | 20 | < 5 s |
| ~10k files | 50 | < 30 s |

Main costs are type-checker setup (2 programs) and `findReferences`. Levers if we miss:
cache worktrees and `.tsbuildinfo` by SHA, load only the affected workspace packages,
build a per-file identifier index to prefilter reference search, then a TS 7 adapter (spike S1)
or oxc in the long run.

## 12. Roadmap

| Phase | Deliverable | Done when |
|---|---|---|
| **1. Engine** | `cpr diff base head` → JSON + findings | All fixture cases pass; runs within budget on the dogfood repos. |
| **2. Viewer** | `cpr view` serves a local graph UI with per-symbol diffs | You can review a real PR from the graph alone: click a node → see its diff, callers, findings. |
| **3. GitHub** | `cpr pr 123`: review, comment, approve | Comments land on the right lines; approve/request-changes works like `gh pr review`. |
| **4. Interdiff** | Show only what changed between PR versions | Re-review after a force-push shows only the new deltas. |
| **5. CI** | GitHub Action that posts findings | Action runs on a PR and posts a summary + inline findings. |

**Later:** more languages via adapters, a faster core (TS 7 adapter or Rust/oxc), self-hosted team mode.

### Phase 1 milestones

| # | Milestone | Output |
|---|---|---|
| M0 ✅ | Scaffolding | pnpm workspace, TS strict, vitest, eslint, prettier, CI on push |
| M1 ✅ | Git layer | ref resolve, merge-base, changed files, worktree cache |
| M2 ✅ | Extraction | symbol IDs + both hashes, fixture tests |
| M3 ✅ | Diff + moves | change classification, exact move matching |
| M4 ✅ | References | incoming/outgoing edges, alias resolution, context nodes |
| S1 ✅ | TS 7 spike | Prototype adapter on `typescript/unstable/sync`; compare speed and results with ts-morph on fixtures and dogfood repos |
| M5 | Detectors | the three v1 rules |
| M6 | Output + CLI | graph JSON v0.1, human summary, `--fail-on` |
| M7 | Dogfood | measured runtime + false-positive notes on 3 repos |

## 13. Risks

| Risk | Mitigation |
|---|---|
| `findReferences` too slow on big repos | Only changed symbols; prefilter by identifier index; per-package loading. |
| Missing `node_modules` in worktrees breaks types | Symlink from main checkout; external symbols are leaves; base/head lockfile drift is accepted in v1. |
| Symbol IDs unstable across refactors | Move matching by body hash; `previousId` on the node. |
| Graph too big to read | UI collapses context nodes and groups by file/package by default. |
| TS 7 compiler API is published as `unstable` | Only behind the adapter boundary; ts-morph stays the default until it stabilizes. |
| A ts-morph upgrade moves to a TS 7–based compiler | Pin the exact version; the legacy-config fixture must pass before upgrading. |
| ts-morph memory use with two projects | Load sides one after the other and keep only extracted data, not both ASTs. |

## 14. Decisions

| # | Question | Decision | Why |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | Package manager | **pnpm** workspaces | Fast, strict about undeclared deps, standard for TS monorepos. |
| 2 | Inferred return type in signature hash | **Only when unannotated** (§6.3) | Catches silent contract changes without noise on annotated code. |
| 3 | Type-only references | **Always collected, hidden by default** in the UI | Needed for blast radius when an interface or type changes. |
| 4 | Context depth | **1 hop**, `--depth n` to widen | Small graphs by default, more context on demand. |
| 5 | Worktree cache location | **`$XDG_CACHE_HOME/cpr`** (outside the repo) | Worktrees inside the repo would be picked up by tsc, eslint, test runners and file watchers. |
| 6 | Minimum Node | **22.12** | Node 20 is EOL; Vitest 5 requires ≥ 22.12. CI runs Node 22 and 24. |
| 7 | TypeScript for our own code | **6.0.x**, not 7 | TS 7 (the Go port) is `latest`, but typescript-eslint supports `<6.1`. ts-morph bundles its own compiler, so the engine is unaffected. Revisit when lint tooling supports 7. |
| 8 | Compiler behind the engine | **ts-morph (bundles TS 6.0)** for v1; TS 7 adapter as spike S1 after M4 | TS 7's compiler API is `unstable` and ts-morph doesn't support it yet. The adapter boundary lets us swap later. |
| 9 | After spike S1 | **Stay on ts-morph for v1** | TS 7 matched results (99.9 % of use sites) and loaded 4–7× faster, but reference search was only 1.6–3.5× faster over IPC, the API is unstable, and an adapter means porting extraction and hashing to a new AST. See [spikes/ts7](../spikes/ts7/README.md). |
